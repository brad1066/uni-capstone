# User Feedback for GoLearn

## User 1

- seems to run fine, a bit odd having the update button be at the top next to
  "user data" but that might just be my preferences being weird, i cant see any
  courses (did you make a template one?) but from what i can see it all looks
  good.
- I guess you could also move the "courses" from the dropdown to perhaps a bar
  at the top (as im not sure if its an admin view thing, but the page looks
  kinda empty)
- bit more of a UX thing, but the top bar is sorta empty, may be worth adding
  courses or something, maybe tailor it to the type of user? e.g admins see
  "add new user" or "add new course" and teachers see "add student to course"
  and students have either a drop down or just a small box for each module?
  outside of the refresh page there isn't anything major
